All the work for this app was dived between tomer and I equally. We usually met up on campus
and watched youtube videos reagrding each topic and worked together to implement that feature
in our app. I would say work load was equally distributed and managed by both us. Neither of us
had any complaints. We just wished we did not have too many classes this sem to focus more on the app.

Thank you
