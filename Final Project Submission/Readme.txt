Short Report:
School view is an app that allows current student and former students to rate the campus of a college or university.
They can rate different aspects of the college such as dinning, academics, athletics and dinning. 
This allows future attendes of that college to decide if they would like to go to that university or not. 
They are also able to read detailed reviews 

Installation:
To use these files, the machine must have XCode installed (only on Mac), and must install every file due to there being external libraries being used in
the development process. 
Also, "Mobile App School View IOS" Folder would need to be downloaded.
Once that is download, open the folder and there will be a "MobileAppSchoolViewIOS.xcodeproj" File.
That is main file that can be opened. It will launch with Xcode and will display all of our code files.
Once the file is opened, It can be ran by using the "cmd+R" shortcut on keyboard and it will open the simulation.
If the simulation does not open, an iphone must be connected to the machine via a usb to lightning cable.
This would allow the app to run on iphone.

App Instructions:
When launching the app, the user is greeted with a log in or sign up page. 
If sign up is pressed, the user is taken through the sign up process. 
If login is pressed, it will take the user to the main page. 
On the main page they are able to search for different schools,
as well as look at the rating for UMASS Lowell.
They can read the reviews for each catagory upon clicking the button.
