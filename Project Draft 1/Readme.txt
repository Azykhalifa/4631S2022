Short Report:
School view is an app that allows current student and former students to rate the campus of a college or university.
They can rate different aspects of the college such as dinning, academics, athletics and dinning. 
This allows future attendes of that college to decide if they would like to go to that university or not. 
They are also able to read detailed reviews 

Installation:
To use these files, the machine must have XCode installed (only on Mac), and must install every file due to there being external libraries being used in
the development process.

App Instructions:
When launching the app, the user is greeted with a log in or sign up page. If login is pressed, it will take the user to the main page. If sign up is 
pressed, the user is taken through the sign up process. Everything else about the app is self explanatory. Account setup does not work yet, we need to setup firebase for that.
