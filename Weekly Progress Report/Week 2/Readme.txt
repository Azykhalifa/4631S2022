----------Summary------------------
This is our second progress report for our app. Last week, we created a presentation in which you can find information regarding what the app will be about.
We have not decided the name yet. Since we are starting a new idea from scratch, we decide to make a proposal
like we did in Mobile Apps I. The proposal helped us answer some of the questions we had about the app.

TThis week we worked in xCode and created a login and signup screen. We used swiftUI to create it rather than storyboard because Swift UI is actually challenging.
We ran into lot of difficulties while working on it because neither of us have an experience working with the swiftUI. We watched youtube videos and read
articles on how to successfully create the login screen.

For next week, we are going to try to authenticate the login and signup screen with the google firebase. It is going to be a challenge. We are also looking
to add the screen where the app asks important questions to add an emergency contact


-----------Work Distribution--------------
Tomer worked on the login screen and I worked on the signup screen.
