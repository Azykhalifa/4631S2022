----------Summary------------------
For this week's progress, we were not able to get together to work on our app. We have our exams before the end of the semester 
and since this app is self paced work, we felt like we should prioritize our other class work for the time being
We plan on meeting again this weekend to complete our plans for the app and start working in full gear.

our plan for next week still is the same. we plan to add more school profile. and also add the rating stars and review
sections.
