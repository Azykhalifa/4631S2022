----------Summary------------------
For this week, we added a school profile for one of the schools(UMASS Lowell) on our list. 
We created a separate view with buttons and ratings. If a user clicks on one of those buttons,
It takes them to a different view which shows them detailed reviews rather than just ratings. 

For next week our plan is to create more school profiles which user can search and look or give ratings.
We have to implement stars and make it so the user can give the proper raiting by filling x/5 stars.

-----------Work Distribution--------------
Tomer and I got together and worked on our buttons for a school profile. we both watched videos together
and worked on the implementation of the button as well as linking them to a specific view.
