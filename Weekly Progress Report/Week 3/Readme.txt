----------Summary------------------
This week was a bit hectic for me and my group mate. The reason being we had a lot of work from our other classes.
Also, this week we decided to change our app. We decided to continue the school view app that Tomer was working on last semester
The reason for not doing the Naloxone app is because, we felt like we did not have a clear path of what we wanted to do,
what features we wanted to include and how we wanted users to navigate. We also felt like our solution was a bit controversial to other people.

The reason why we decided to continue school view app is because it was already in the works. and there was a clear idea of what the purpose of the app is.
The new features that we are looking to add, are exciting and would definitely make the app more complete

We plan on using the login and signup page we created last week for our previous app.So our time does not go to waste. We would just have to 
make little changes


-----------Work Distribution--------------
