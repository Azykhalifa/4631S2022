----------Summary------------------
For this week, we added another school profile for one of the schools(Harvard University) on our list. 
For this school we were just able to get the text done. We still have to organize and make it match with 
rest of our UI. This still works when searched but it does not look as clean as the first one.
We created a separate view with buttons and ratings. If a user clicks on one of those buttons,
It takes them to a different view which shows them detailed reviews rather than just ratings. 

For next week we are planning on making the harvard university page more finished 
and also add the star funcationality which the user can use to give raiting.

-----------Work Distribution--------------
Tomer and I got together and worked on our school profile just like last week.
we would like to finish our app in the next couple of weeks.
