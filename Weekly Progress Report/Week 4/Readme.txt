----------Summary------------------
For this week's progress, we decided to implement a search bar which is one of the most important features of our app.
It was not an easy task as me and my groupmate both did not have a proper understanding of how to do that in xCode.
We used online resources to study first and then also used those resources to help us make our search bar by adding some changes to it.

For next week, we plan to add an actual school profile. Once a user searches for a school, then can go ahead and click on a searched school
which then would open that school profile with the ratings and reviews. 


-----------Work Distribution--------------
My part was to create the database with the schools, and Tomer actually hard coded it in xCode. We both helped each other.
