----------Summary------------------
For this week, we added another school profile for one of the schools(Boston University) on our list. 
We have also organized our schools and the way UI looks.
We added the stars as well that are working and can be rated.
I think it looks more neater now. We still have a lot of work to do



-----------Work Distribution--------------
Tomer and I got together and worked on our school profile just like last week.
