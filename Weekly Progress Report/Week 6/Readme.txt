----------Summary------------------
For this week, we improvised on our search bar that we created before. Our search bar was not functional
It was static and would not allow us to type. However, for this week we went ahead and made a separate UI just for 
the search bar and then implemented it in our content-view layout. This allowed it to be functional and responsive.  

For next week our plan is to create school profiles which is the main part of this app. We are not sure
how we are going to do it, but we will definitely try to use external resources and what we have learned to 
get it working.


-----------Work Distribution--------------
Tomer and I got together and worked on our search bar. I worked on the UI of the search bar which is uploaded as 
screenshot 1 file. Tomer implemented the UI which I designed and he synced it with the previous database of schools we had.
Screenshot 2 shows his implementation.
