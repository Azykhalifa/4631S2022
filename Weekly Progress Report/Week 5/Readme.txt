----------Summary------------------
For this week's progress, we were not able to get together to work on our app. We are currently running behind. 
The main reason for that is because both of us had midterm exam this week in three of our classes. 
They are our core classes for CS, so we wanted to study and focus as the exam is only a one time opportunity. Whereas we can 
catch up on the app progress this weekend by working few more hours on it.

our plan for next week still is the same. we plan to add an actual school profile. Once a user searches for a school, 
then can go ahead and click on a searched school
which then would open that school profile with the ratings and reviews. 
We are also looking to authenticate the login screen and signup screen with google firebase.
