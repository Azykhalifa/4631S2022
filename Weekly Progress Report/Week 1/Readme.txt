----------Summary------------------
This is our first progress report for our app. We have created a presentation in which you can find information regarding what the app will be about.
We have not decided the name yet. Since we are starting a new idea from scratch, we decide to make a proposal
like we did in Mobile Apps I. The proposal helped us answer some of our questions about the app and what functionality we are looking to implement. 
Then we decoded to create a layout in google slides which demonstrates how our app would look like once developed. The colors and format is subjected to change.
We feel like we have a solid base for our idea and looking to start developing in Xcode soon.

-----------Work Distribution--------------
we both worked on the presentation together
