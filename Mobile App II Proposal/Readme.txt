In our app proposal pdf, you can read what this app is about. To summerize, this app will help students
pick a college to attend based on the reviews and rating of that specific college by past or currenr students.
This app will focus on getting detailed review from users as it will help future new students decide why it is good or bad.
We would also like to include a feature where students can share what are some activites that are being held by the college or
around the campus. Good places to eat, visit and just enjoy the college experience. 

we used google slides to make the mock layout of our app. It is very basic right now as we are just getting started.
But we are looking to start working on it and make it come to life each week.
